","The performance issue in the given code snippet is that the critical section is not properly synchronized, which can lead to race conditions and incorrect results. Specifically, the statement `a += 2 * c` is not guaranteed to be executed atomically with respect to the critical section, which means that other threads may be reading or writing to `a` concurrently, which can result in race conditions and incorrect results.

To fix this issue, you can use the `atomic` directive to ensure that the statement is executed atomically with respect to the critical section. For example:
